Images here are intended only for this assignment. I have no onwership to it.

Throughout the semester, I will be creating a database-driven web application. This first lab starts off with defining the user interface of the site. This is where you define site content and flow as well as express your creativity in web site design.

I highly recommend that you set your expectations low. Don't try to reproduce a modern, responsive template from a site like Wordpress or Squarespace. Construct the simplest, plainest site that meets all of the requirements below.

Don't worry about completing the entire site in one evening. You will have the entire first week of class.

Also, don't worry about getting it absolutely perfect in one week. Focus on content first and foremost. If you are spending too much time tweaking layout and design, consider simplifying and moving on. You'll have plenty of time throughout the semester to improve it.

This lab is not intended to intimidate you. Keep it simple and have fun with it.
